            <h3>DJI Mavic 3 Pro Drone</h3>
            <p>DJI partnered with legendary camera maker Hasselblad for the Mavic 3 drones. But they didn't stop there. With the Pro, you've got 3 lenses to play with. All of them shoot in 4K, and two can roll at 120 FPS. Here's where your wide-angle Hasselblad really pushes the envelope, though. Not only will you capture epic landscapes with its 24 mm equivalent focal length, but you can also get footage in stunning 5.1K. For picking subjects out of tricky environments, you'll want those two tele lenses. And it's easy to tweak focal lengths with the DJI RC Pro remote controller. The RC Pro is a major upgrade. It has a 5.5" HD display and it works great in bright sunlight - so no need for your phone.</p>
